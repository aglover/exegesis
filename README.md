# CoffeeScript - Mongoose - MongoDB dictionary app

This project is a Node web app (using [Express](http://expressjs.com/)) that leverages [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) for a datastore. 
The source code is [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/). ORM is facilitated by [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/), which is a Mongoid-like 
framework (if you are coming from the Ruby community) in that it allows you to create model objects that represent documents. The API is fairly
straightforward; if you're familiar with native Mongo query semantics then you'll pick up Mongoose quickly. For more information and examples of 
Mongoose, check out the tests in the `test` directory of this project. 

## Installation

Make sure you are on a current version of Node and have CoffeeScript installed. First grab all the required dependencies via `npm install` and then 
type `coffee app/App.coffee`. 

Note, to connect to a valid instance of Mongo, you'll need a username and password; what's more, you'll need to export them so that the process can read them at runtime like so:

```
$>export MONGO_USER=...
$>export MONGO_PASSWORD=...
```

## Running the tests

This project uses [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) and [should](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js) -- to run these tests, type `cake test`.

Note, the tests assume you have Mongo running locally.
